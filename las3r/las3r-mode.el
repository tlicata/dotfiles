INDENT-POINT is the position where the user typed TAB, or equivalent.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.

If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function
which has a non-nil property `lisp-indent-function',
that specifies how to do the indentation.  The property value can be
* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style;
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially

  arguments like a body;
* a function to call just as this function was called.

  the indentation.
